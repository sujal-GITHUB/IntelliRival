# Infosys Competitor Intelligence Tool

A web application that analyzes which competitors of Infosys have worked with or are currently working with Virgin Media.

## Overview

This tool simulates an AI-powered competitive intelligence system that scans publicly available information to find evidence of collaboration between **Virgin Media** and competitors of **Infosys**.

The findings include:

- Which competitors have worked with Virgin Media  
- The nature of their collaboration/relationship  
- Links to sources where the information was found  
- Confidence level of the findings  

## Features

- Detailed analysis of competitor relationships  
- Visual network graph of connections (via D3.js)  
- Confidence ratings for each finding  
- Links to source material for verification  
- Responsive UI for all devices  

## Architecture

### Backend

- **Node.js + Express** for server-side logic  
- Simulated web scraping and data analysis  
- RESTful API endpoint for retrieving competitor analysis  

### Frontend

- **HTML/CSS + Bootstrap** for responsive layout  
- JavaScript for interactivity  
- **D3.js** for graph visualization  
- EJS templating for dynamic server-side rendering

## Technical Approach

- **Data Collection**: Simulated web scraping/API queries for competitor relationships  
- **Data Analysis**: Assigns confidence levels and extracts relationship context  
- **Visualization**: Interactive D3.js network graph  
- **UI**: Responsive EJS + Bootstrap frontend for easy navigation and insights  

## Technical Decisions

- Simulated data used for demo; real scraping or APIs can be plugged in later  
- D3.js chosen for powerful, flexible graph rendering  
- EJS for clean templating with Express  
- Bootstrap for quick, responsive design
  
## Future Enhancements

- Real-time web scraping from sources like press releases and news sites  
- AI/NLP analysis to extract relationship sentiment and strength  
- User login with saved analysis sessions  
- Export options (PDF, CSV, CRM integration)  
- Multi-company analysis capabilities
